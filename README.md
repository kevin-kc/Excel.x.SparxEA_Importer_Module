# Excel.x.SparxEA_Importer_Module

Lengthy module that allows one to import rows in excel as objects in Sparx Enterprise Architecture. Each row is a new object, objects have parents and children. Objects properties can be set as well, represented by a column in the spreadsheet. Mainly tested with importing packages and elements under them. Coded with exporting to excel and other microsoft products in mind, allowing for syncing easily between Excel and Sparx EA.
